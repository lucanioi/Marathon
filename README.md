# Marathon
quick benchmark testing for medium to large chunks of code

## Setup
```shell
$ bundle install
```

## Usage
Copy and paste the code you want to benchmark the 'runner' filesâ€”put the setup code (class, module, method definitions, etc) above the indicated line and the the actual bit of code you want to benchmark below. Then run
```shell
$ rake marathon
```
or 
```shell
$ rake m
```
Optionally you can run the code in any number of loops by passing an integer as an argument
```shell
$ rake marathon 1000 # will run the code 1000 times
```
To cleanup the files afterwards, simply run
```shell
$ rake marathon clean
```
